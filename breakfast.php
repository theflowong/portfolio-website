									<strong>From an animal's perspective, breakfast is a meal of mourning.</strong></p>
									<p>We know that bacon comes from slaughtered pigs,
										but eggs and dairy often have cruel side effects too.<p>
									With efficiency comes cruelty in our food industry:
										to weed out unproductive units of production,
										baby male chicks are ground up alive from the egg industry,
										and calves are slaughtered for veal in the dairy industry.</p>
									<p>We often distance ourselves from food
										and forget that these units of production suffer and
										have emotions as well.</p>
									<p>Hopefully this is a reminder that they do,
										often as a result of our collective food choices.</p>
