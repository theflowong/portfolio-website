# flowong.com
The source code of my former art portfolio website http://flowong.com.

(From 2018, I've since switched to a website on Squarespace, as I wanted to focus more on the content of my website rather than constantly iterating on its development.)

Uses HTML, CSS, SASS, PHP, Javascript.

## How to Install and View Locally

You can always view my website on the world wide webz, but if you want to view it on your own local web server, here is one way to go about installing and viewing the content.

These instructions are also for my own good, because I have the memory capacity of a pickle.

### 1. Set up your local web server.

   Since my site has dynamic content that uses PHP, you'll need to have your local web server set up. I use MAMP.

### 2. Save the repository.

   Download and save this portfolio-website directory into /Applications/MAMP/htdocs. Rename the directory however you want; mine is locally named flowong.com (instead of portfolio-website here on GitHub). Thus, *my* local path to this directory would be /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/flowong.com.

### 3. Start Apache and MySQL servers in MAMP.
  Use MAMP to start Apache and MySQL servers. If this doesn't work, I'm sorry. That happened to me too. Anyway, I just updated MAMP, and started the free trial of MAMP Pro, and it fixed everything. Try that.
  
### 4. Access the site on your web browser.
  Open up your web browser. The site should be accessible through http://localhost:8888/folder-name. For example, if your directory is named flowong.com (like mine), the site will be http://localhost:8888/flowong.com.
