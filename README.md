## How to Install and View Locally

You can always view my website on the world wide webz, but if you want to view it on your own local web server, here is one way to go about installing and viewing the content.

### 1. Set up your local web server.

   Since my site has dynamic content that uses PHP, you'll need to have your local web server set up. I use MAMP.

### 2. Save the repository.

   Download and save this portfolio-website directory into /Applications/MAMP/htdocs. Rename the directory however you want; mine is locally named flowong.com (instead of portfolio-website here on GitHub). Thus, *my* path to this directory would be /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/flowong.com.

### 3. Start Apache and MySQL servers in MAMP.
  Use MAMP to start Apache and MySQL servers. If this doesn't work, I'm sorry.
  
### 4. Access the site on your web browser.
  Open up your web browser. The site should be accessible through http://localhost:8888/folder-name. For example, if your directory is named flowong.com (like mine), the site will be http://localhost:8888/flowong.com.
