								<p>As consumers, we're constantly surrounded by advertisements
								that feed us unreliable information and make us desire more than we need.</p>
								<p>This is a series of more truthful advertisements that comment
								on aspects of our food industry regarding our oppressive relationships with
								non-human animals, ranging
						<!--</p>
							</section>
							<section>
						<p>-->
								from the evident concept that a consumer choice
								results in the death of an animal, to more obscure, lesser-known realities
								like artificial insemination processes or the grinding up of male chicks
								in the milk and egg industry.</p>
								<p>By mimicking particular trademark brands
								and commercials, the series aims to convey the very own hush-hush
								secrets of the industry that advertisements try to conceal
								in the first place.</p>
