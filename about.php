					<h2>About Flo</h2>
					<p>Hi! I'm a firm believer in living life with optimism and kindness,
						and spreading it to others in any way we can.</p>
						<p>I'm an artist, meddler, and listener,
						and try to use my abilities to be a voice for those
						who are often unheard.</p>
						<p>Here are a few things I'm always actively trying to work on:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>strengthening communities</li>
							<li>promoting equal opportunity</li>
							<li>breaking stereotypes</li>
							<li>having respect and compassion for all life forms</li>
							<li>practicing nonviolent communication</li>
							<li>encouraging moral reflection and consistency</li>
							<li>raising awareness and compassion for animals in the food industry</li>

						</ul>
						<p>Here are things I'm currently exploring and would love to learn more about:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>effective altruism</li>
							<li>longboarding</li>
							<li>minimalism (reducing material possessions)</li>
							<li>web and mobile development (like learning all this
						<a class="random">random</a>
						<a class="random2">tech</a>
						<a class="showing_off">stuff</a><span class="whoa">!)
						<span class="secret">Whoa! You discovered Secret 1 (of 5)!</span><span>
						</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Right now, I'm living in and loving Minneapolis, MN, USA.
							It's an artistic mecca fortified by these amazingly
							strong communities and people — I find myself
							constantly inspired by those around me,
							and feeling lucky to be where I am.
							I'm currently working at the Walker Art Center and Highpoint Center for Printmaking,
							promoting the arts scene among local communities in Minneapolis.</p>
						<p>I grew up in Hong Kong with TCKs
							in an international school,
							and graduated in 2016 from
							a LAC Carleton College with a Studio Art degree.</p>
							<p>On the side, I'm having a blast diving in with
							web design/development — currently tackling
							responsive web and mobile design and making
							things accessible. This site is actually under
							development for that, so excuse any weird bugs.
							If you see any in particular, please let me know,
							but there's a chance
							I'm probably already in the process of fixing them!</p>
						<br>
					<h2>Want to exchange ideas?</h2>
						<p>Flo is happy to work with fellow artists, vegans,
							activists, humans, organizations and small businesses,
							especially those promoting:

								<li>LGBTQIA+ and racial equality</li>
								<li>help for international students and immigrants</li>
								<li>plant-based advocacy</li>

							</ul>
							She wears many hats, and is
							available to help with
							creative requests (small or large!)
							with design, web development or arts. This can include:
							<ul>
								<li>Creating illustrations for articles, posts, online content</li>
								<li>Getting feedback on website or app interfaces</li>
								<li>Creating digital painting thank-you postcards</li>
							</ul>
