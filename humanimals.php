									Humans generally think of animals as units of production,
									objects to use for advantaging the human. Yet similarly to us,
									animals feel pain, suffer, and the desire to live and be social.</p>
									<p>For five months, I created large-scale (4 feet tall) oil paintings
										of humorous human-animal role-reversal scenarios
										to hopefully foster empathy and reflection on the situations
										we put animals in.</p>
										<!--
								<p>Let’s face it: our world is undeniably anthropocentric.</p>
								<p>As humans, we’ve outdone every other species.
									We’re different; we philosophize, produce art and music,
									and battle in the name of politics and religion.
									Yet our defining characteristics that distinguish
									us from the rest of the world bring us back to
									take responsibility and care for it;
									to be human is to be humane.
									We’re in the midst of a social justice era,
									yet one system of oppression we tend to overlook —
									and often indirectly support — is the oppression
									against nonhuman animals in our daily lives.</p>
									<p>Through my art, I wish to explore the way
										humans interact with animals.
										By depicting scenarios where roles
										of humans and nonhumans are reversed —
										literally placing humans in the shoes of animals —
										I hope to use humor as a tool to let viewers
										contemplate the absurdity of situations we place
										nonhuman animals in, and reflect on their own
										everyday consumption that may support these systems.

								<p><em>"Walk the Human"</em>
									is the first of three in my "Humanimals"
									painting series, inspired by Dan Piraro's
									"Bizarro!" comic panels, imagining a world
									in which roles of humans and animals are reversed.
								</p>
								<p>Compared to the other two paintings in the series,
									"Walk the Human" focuses on a less serious issue:
									of dogs walking humans to the point of exhaustion.</p>
									<p>As the first piece introducing us to the series,
									"Walk the Human" is intended to create a light
									sense of humor, bringing viewers in.
									With this, I hope to include viewers in the laughter,
									intending to make them receptive to the other
									more pressing issues addressed in the series,
									as they realize the absurdity and sometimes
									cruelty of everyday scenarios we place animals in.

								<p>"Human Decor" shows a deer inhabiting a space with human taxidermies, making us question: is it necessary to take lives for the mere purpose of decorating homes?

								<p>The faces I used for "Human Decor" are those of my friends, hoping to bring a dark humorous twist to the painting.

								<p>I used a baby to replace the role of lab-tested mice — babies, although not as intelligent as older adults, still embody complex emotions and vulnerability. We feel entitled to empathize with it, so we face the question: if intelligence is not the factor that summons empathy, what distinguishes animals from humans that limit our empathy towards them?
