									<p>My college friend and roommate Michelle Mastrianni and I recently
										moved into Minneapolis together, and had a crazy idea to start
										a late-night food delivery business — for college students with
										dietary restrictions or those who wanted healthy alternatives
										to the usual late-night greasy pizza snack.</p>
									<p>We decided on the name Moon Lite Bites, and here were some
										logo/brand designs I came up with. We're targetting
										a young audience, so I decided to create a youthful
										playful feel, with a simple logo and handwritten typography.
										I experimented with different color schemes, but we ended up
										choosing a dark sky background with the yellow/orange curve
										to allude to the night sky (and also healthy fruits — I like that
										the shape resembles a banana or peach as well.)</p>
									<p>As for the Carleton College penguin: I've always thought
										that our mascot shouldn't have been the knight, but rather, the penguin.
										It seems more fitting, as it resembles the stereotypical Carl:
										awkward, and often found in frozen
										tundras.</p>
