								<p>As consumers, we're constantly surrounded by advertisements
								that feed us unreliable information and make us desire more than we need.</p>
								<p>This is a series of more truthful advertisements that comment
								on aspects of our food industry regarding our oppressive relationships with
								non-human animals, ranging
						<!--</p>
							</section>
							<section>
						<p>-->
								from the evident concept that a consumer choice
								results in the death of an animal, to more obscure, lesser-known realities
								like artificial insemination processes or the grinding up of male chicks
								in the milk and egg industry.</p>
								<p>By mimicking particular trademark brands
								and commercials, the series aims to convey the very own hush-hush
								secrets of the industry that advertisements try to conceal
								in the first place.</p>

								<p><em>I'm Mournin' It</em> is the first of three

								<p>Using iconic McDonald's colors and

								<em>I'm Mournin' It</em> shows the literal meat of a burger.

								<p><em>Got Consent?</em> is the second of three

								<p>Dairy cows must be pregnant to produce milk.
									As a result, the milk industry has to
									constantly artificially inseminate and impregnate cows
									to induce lactation.</p>
								<p><em>Got Consent?</em> is an alternative reading
									on the "Got Milk?" advertisements that

								<p><em>Kinder Egg</em> is the third of three in my "Honest Food Advertisements" series parodying iconic food advertisements, instead depicting the animals’ perspectives of these food items.</p>
								<p>Male chicks (making up half of hatched eggs) are ground up alive when born, as they are unable to lay eggs and provide no production value for the egg industry.</p>
								<p><em>Kinder Egg</em> is a take on a real product called "Kinder" egg, a real brand that sells egg-shaped chocolates instead of real chicken eggs.</p>
